I have the self-imposed restriction to not use any AI to figure out the answers. I have allowed myself to do some old fasion google/stack overflow searches though.

I can take as long as I like and didn't do them 1 day to the next.

I also didn't always finish a single day in 1 day due to my busy schedule.

Ultimately this is both a refresher of my Python knowledge but also an oppertunity to solve some different problems I may not have faced before, ultimately learning even more about coding techniques.
